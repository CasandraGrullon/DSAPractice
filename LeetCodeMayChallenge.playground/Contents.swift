//Day 1
//You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

//Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one

//You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

//Given n = 5, and version = 4
//call isBadVersion(3) -> false
//call isBadVersion(5) -> true
//call isBadVersion(4) -> true

//Then 4 is the first bad version.


func firstBadVersion(_ n: Int) -> Int {
    
    
}
