//Given an integer n, return a string with n characters such that each character in such string occurs an odd number of times.
// example
//Input: n = 4
//Output: "pppz"
//Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".
